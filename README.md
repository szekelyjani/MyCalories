Calorie counter application

In 2022 I had started a diet, and have already lost 17 kg. So I decided to create my own calorie counter application.
I found Calorieninjas API, where you can find multiple foods.
On the main screen there is a logo and the total calories what you added previously.
You are able to use the tab bar navigation on the bottom, or you can swipe.
On the Diary page there is a table view with daily meals. You can add foods with "Add Food" button on the top left, and edit the list with the "Edit" button.
When you click on "Add Food" a new interface shows up. Here, you could fill in the food you want to add, and click on "Search". The following view shows the results. Click on the item, set the meal, the amount and click on the "Add" button.
On the "Challenge" view, please use the red round to count your push ups. On this same page, you are able to set a notification, in order to keep in mind the daily challenge.
